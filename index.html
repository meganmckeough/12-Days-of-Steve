					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Classic Steve</span></h3>
					<p>What a way to start the festive season – with Classic Steve. His hair isn’t in full bloom yet, he’s not yet half of Stancy, and he’s really leaning in to this fairly one-note James Spader impersonation. His charisma is only cranking on about a 4 to 5 here, and we’re yet to get a full glimpse of the glory to come. Not yet King Steve, and certainly still a couple cliches away from becoming Dad Steve – classic Steve is but a cardboard cutout, a mere shadow of what he will eventually become. But every hero has to start somewhere, and this is Steve’s equivalent of living with the Dursleys - don’t worry though, things get better.</p>

					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Jerk Steve</span></h3>
					<p>Let’s get all of Steve’s low points out of the way quickly, which I believe to be not the fault of Steve but rather poor character development and slow enlightenment on behalf of the show’s writers. To appreciate the beautiful phoenix that will be end of Season 2 Steve, we need to remember Steve’s dark period. But it’s not called a hero’s journey for nothing, and in his quest to bad-assery, Steve does stray from his path for a short while. He breaks cameras, graffitis abusive slogans, and hangs out with a pack of dickheads. Okay okay so Steve wasn’t always protecting the kids, leaping in front of demo-dogs and glancing longingly through car windows. Dark Steve – we still see you.</p>

					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Bloody Steve</span></h3>
					<p>Part of the joy of Steve is that he may be king of Hawkins High but he also gets kicked to the curb at least once per season. He still looks good all bloodied up, to be fair, and the real joy comes from realising that Steve goes from getting his ass handed to him for what I call fair enough reasons (remember the Nancy “The Slut” Wheeler thing?) to doing it in defense of the kids. *sniff*</p>

					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Colonel Steve</span></h3>
					<p>A brilliant part of the Season 2 opener, and real way to set the scene between our formerly beloved high-school couple. I mean, things are clearly not right here. I’m not talking about Barb’s “unsolved” disappearance, Nancy’s far too coordinated jumper combo or that wallpaper (because let’s face it, it’s fabulous). While we love Steve even when he’s shoveling 11 secret herbs and spices into his beautiful mug (um, especially when) but we can see the faint despair and tinge of denial in his eyes. Stancy isn’t long for this world.</p>

					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Demo-dog Steve</span></h3>
					<p>Today we have Demo-dog Steve. Demo-dog Steve is the best babysitter we’ve seen since the kids from Stoneybrook - he plans, he plots, he drops raw meat, he runs out into a fetid, foggy junkyard because when you’re Season 2 Steve, that’s just what you do to protect those loveable losers. His hair is in full flight here, he’s got his signature weapon, and he’s glowing with a sense of life’s purpose.
					We agree with you Dustin. He’s awesome.</p>

				<aside>
					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Heartbreak Steve</span></h3>
					<p>If your heart didn’t break in two for Steve here, you’re made of stone and I’m not even sure why you’re here. We’re not fooled by the casual towel around the neck and the legs akimbo stance - the distinct pall of rejection gives him away. His transformation has begun, triggered by soul-crushing heartbreak, and he’s about to break free of Nancy, that doomed relationship, and the shackles of being a Season 1 afterthought. A side character no more – and what a beautiful thing it is, as are those basketball shorts.</p>

					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Protector Steve</span></h3>
					<p>Steve running outside to protect Beverly Marsh ahem sorry I mean Max might be a moral high point for the character and certainly some pretty exciting tension because Billy is a real jackass. It’s also almost too much hair glory to fit into one frame. Going head to head like this, it’s Ice Man meets Maverick, Malfoy meets Potter, and so on and so forth (this isn’t meant to be a comment on incidental latent homoeroticism in pop culture, or maybe it is).</p>

					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Junkyard Steve</span></h3>
					<p>Yes, Steve really gives Keanu a run for his money for most heroic action undertaken while on a bus. While the plan seems overall to be somewhat flawed (is Steve smart? We're not sure.), it gave Steve plenty of opportunities to leap into the fray and protect the gang. Steve’s no mere love interest anymore – he drives the plot, brings tension and forms his own individual relationships with actual main characters. Take that Season 1 Steve.</p>

				<aside>
					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Party Steve</span></h3>
					<p>This day seems like a good day to remember how darn happy Party Steve was … until Nancy tore out his beautiful heart. To be fair, Season 1 Steve probably deserved such treatment. But Season 2 Steve … the look in his eyes when he asks if she loves him? Her callous response? Now that is bullshit. But for a few fleeting moments, there was joyous, dancing Steve … a gift to gif makers everywhere and more endorsement for Ray Ban.</p>

				<aside>
					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Christmas Steve</span></h3>
					<p>While certainly appreciated on an aesthetic level, Christmas Steve was a bit of a surprise, granted. Not the fact that he looks so damn good in that Christmas reindeer number, that was always meant to be, but rather that Nancy decided to cuddle up to him as the lights went down on Season 1 (instead of lurking somewhere with Jonathan). Steve did redeem himself with his fine performance at Joyce’s place, in one hell of a Demogorgon-y climax, but this cuddly couch scene was still a bit of a left turn. <br>But look at that hair. You bet your socks it was feeling festive.</p>

				<img src="images/steve/11adviceSteve.jpg" alt="Steve stranger things season 2">
				<aside>
					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Advice Steve</span></h3>
					<p>Look, Steve does fail to remember that he’s Steve, and that Dustin is Dustin, but his heart is in the right place. Not only did he share his secret to luscious locks, he’s genuinely invested in Dustin’s potential and prowess, beyond more than a casual Stand By Me-inspired train tracks heart to heart. This drop off to end all drop offs is completed by a longing but self-aware gaze towards the (undeserving) Nancy. Hang in there Steve. You’re the cream that’s risen to the top above all the other boys, who are mere milk.</p>

				<aside>
					<h3>You've unwrapped <br><span>Dad Steve</span></h3>
					<p>We made it! HAPPY HOLIDAYS! Let’s celebrate with the most beloved Steve, the Steve of true character growth, maturity and gusto - Dad Steve. He’s the Steve we want to leave here remembering. He is protector of Dustins, fighter of Demo-dogs, and all around redeemed good guy. Season 1 Steve seems but a distant memory - now his advice is heartfelt, his intentions pure, and his hair higher than ever. It’s hard to believe that we ever thought that Steve wasn’t one of the top three things about this show. Have a great Christmas season!</p>
